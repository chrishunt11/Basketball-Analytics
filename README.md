# NBA Home Games
## Analyzing Home Wins

**Author**: Christopher Hunt

### Business Problem:

The main objective for NBA teams is to win as many games as possible, but the challenge is figuring out the most efficient way possible. Since the game is constantly changing, the most efficient way to win has varied over the years. Should teams shoot more 3's? Should they shoot as many shots as possible regardless if they are good shots or not? Figuring out the answer to these questions is what I am trying to solve.

### Data Source:
